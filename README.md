#### Improbable

#### QuantumBlack

QuantumBlack has been mandated to help a national supervisory body rethink the way they assess the financial health of companies they monitor.The objective is to design a data driven approach that will help predict company bankruptcies and subsequently enable identification of thebest remedies.

Challenge

- Build a predictive model for company bankruptcies
- Identify optimal remedial actions to reduce
- the likelihood of bankruptcies for well-defined subsets of risky companies

Find out more details at our workshop on Saturday at 4.45pm!



#### Microsoft Cogniiive Services

Artificial intelligence isn’t just for processing requests and synthesizing data anymore. Now, technology such as Cognitive Services allow developersto understand sentiment, a trend known as affective computing. The idea is, that by understanding emotions, artificially intelligent technology couldpredict a person’s needs in drastically more human ways.

So can you use facial expressions to determine how much user is engaged with your content or even greet them with a smile? The challenge - develop asolution that Relies on the Cognitive Services or Microsoft Bot Framework and has at least one of the following

- Use emotion detection to provide a new means of interaction with the user of the application.
- Solve or improve a real-world problem.
- Incorporate the use of a cameras (whether in phones, robots using Kinect, Realsense or Laptop/Mobile inbuilt Camera).
- Provided in an application for Web or iOS, Android and Windows 10



#### eLife 

Are you interested in the benefit that open access, open science and open data could bring to the world? The way thatscientific research is shared and evaluated still bears the legacy of a system based around print media. New technologiesin the digital era present a huge opportunity to accelerate discovery and make science collaborative instead ofcompetitive. Will you help us to transform biology with technology?

At Hack Cambridge, we challenge you to develop a prototype tool or technological solution that improves how scientists,academics and the public interact with cutting-edge research. You could explore ways to help researchers share their ownwork or review their peers’ work in a fast, transparent and collaborative manner, your tool could enhance thediscoverability or accessibility of new research, or you may have a completely new idea for how we can make the bestscience even better. Whatever you build, we’ll be looking out for ideas that utilise the eLife API, showcase openresearch outputs (papers, data, code), or build on other openly-available resources in research technology.



#### Argon

We challenge you to connect a speech-to-text engine to a LSTM machine 
learning network to a text-to-speech engine. Users can then speak to the
device for a while (or select a personality trained from a pre-existing 
corpus of text). Then I can say half a sentence and allow the “Sentence
Finisher” to predict and say the rest. We’ll bring along some Amazon 
Echo Dots to provide the voice I/O and our engineers will be pitching in
 to
help teams who want to explore and create some interesting examples in 
this area. [See here](http://www.argondesign.com/news/2017/jan/11/hack-cambridge-2017/)
below for more information.



#### Skyscanner

[Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/) allows users to compare millions of flights to find the cheapest deal, fast.

The Skyscanner API is composed of services that can be used either individually, to add travel search functionality to an existing product, orcombined, to build a fully-fledged travel search product. The best project using our API in any way gets our prize!





#### Pusher Feeds

Did you use Feeds at Hack Cambridge? We want to get your feedback about your experience. Hackers who complete the feedback forminside the Feeds dashboard as well as include a a link to a repo (Github, Bitbucket, anything really) that uses Feeds will receive a £10 Amazonvoucher and enter you into a raffle to win a programmable BB8 droid!

Send feedback on the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet-xiiNurEFUwIVI6l8utjrl4kE57GBnVzULaszTp6VyyJdQ/viewform).
