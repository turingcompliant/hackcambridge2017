TODO for data processing

========================

> Feature scaling
    - Many ML algorithms behave better if all training features are roughly of the same scale
    - see sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler or .MinMaxScaler

> Feature selection / Dimensionality reduction
    - Find which data is redundant/correlated and remove it
    - Eliminate noise (data which doesn't correlate at all with bankruptcy)
    - Can find feature importance using sklearn random forest classifier
    - see LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
